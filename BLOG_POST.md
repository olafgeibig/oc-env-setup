# The Ultimate OpenCode Multi-Instance Terminal Setup

Running multiple OpenCode instances simultaneously is a game-changer for productivity. Instead of switching between different AI conversations, you can have dedicated assistants for different tasks—one for frontend work, another for backend, a third for testing, and a fourth for documentation—all visible at once in terminal panes.

This setup gives you everything you need in **one automated install**: ultra-fast Ghostty terminal, unlimited command history, modern CLI tools, and tmux for managing multiple AI assistants effortlessly.

## What You Get in One Install

**🚀 One Command Setup:**
```bash
./install.sh
```

This automated installer gives you:

- **Ultra-fast Ghostty terminal** with perfect font sizing and window controls
- **Unlimited command history** (999 million lines) with smart search
- **Modern CLI tools** - ripgrep, fd, bat, eza, zoxide for blazing workflows  
- **tmux multiplexer** for persistent sessions and split panes
- **Auto-suggestions** that predict commands as you type
- **fzf integration** with file previews and fuzzy completion
- **Git aliases** and productivity shortcuts built-in

## Multiple OpenCode Instances Made Easy

The real power comes from running multiple AI assistants simultaneously:

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ OpenCode #1     │ OpenCode #2     │
│ Frontend Work   │ Backend API     │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ OpenCode #3     │ OpenCode #4     │
│ Writing Tests   │ Documentation   │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

**Launch 4 instances instantly:**
```bash
oc4  # Creates a 2x2 grid of OpenCode instances
```

**Navigate effortlessly:**
- `Ctrl+A |` - Split terminal vertically  
- `Ctrl+A -` - Split terminal horizontally
- `Ctrl+H/J/K/L` - Jump between panes instantly
- `oc` - Launch new OpenCode in any pane

## Key Features That Save Hours Daily

**Smart Command Predictions:**
- Type `ec` → see `echo "test"` suggested in gray → press `→` to accept
- Unlimited history means better predictions over time

**Fuzzy Search Everything:**
- `Ctrl+T` - Find any file with live preview
- `Ctrl+R` - Search unlimited command history  
- `Alt+C` - Navigate directories with tree view
- `**<Tab>` - Fuzzy completion for any command

**Modern CLI Shortcuts:**
- `gs` → `git status`
